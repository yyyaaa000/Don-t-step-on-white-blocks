# Don-t-step-on-white-blocks
This is a little interesting game, calls "Don't step on white blocks". 
The rule is simple. Always tap on the black blocks, don't let the black blocks touch the bottom line, and don't click on the white blocks. If players obey the rule, game end, and they will find their final score on the pop-up interface.
In this game, I use CSS, HTLM, and JavaScript.
